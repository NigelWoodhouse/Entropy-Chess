# Entropy-Chess
Entropy Chess, the game

Randomly generates the FEN position which can be copy-pasted into any computer engine.
Frequently creates starting positions that are very unbalanced for one color, or infesiable positions (both kings are in check). Will likely require many iterations to create a workable starting position.
